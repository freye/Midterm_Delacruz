			<h2>ABOUT MAMBAJAO</h2>
            <p>The name MAMBAJAO is believed to have come from two Cebuano-Visayan origins. One version is derived from the phrase “naay bahaw” or “there is a cooked rice leftover” and the other, and more popularly known, is from the word “mamahaw”, meaning “ tohave breakfast”.</p>
            <p>When the early Spanish colonizers arrived in the island of Camiguin, they named the town “mamahaw” and later became what is called today as “Mambajao”. Mambajao was founded as a town and parish on July 6, 1855 with Señor Don Froilan Basa as the first Governadorcillo 
			and Fr. Valero Salvo de San Sebastian as the parish priest. Nine barangays were created Agoho to Tupsan.</p>

			<p>The eruption of Mt. Vulcan-Daan that caused the total destruction and sinking of the town proper of Guiob-Catagman forced its residents to migrate to new settlements in Mambajao. This in turn created the socio-economic and population growth to over 11,000 of the town 
			by the end of the century.</p>
			<p>When Camiguin Island was elevated to a province by virtue of Republic Act 4669, Mambajao became its capital town. Abaca industry boomed after the May 1, 1871 eruption of Mt. Vulcan that later paved Mambajao to become as an abaca port in Northern Mindanao. In 1888, 
			steamers carried more than P400,000 worth of abaca to Cebu and Manila every four days making it the town’s major economy.</p>
			<p>On November 21, 1901, the American conquerors landed at Cabuan beach. Some locals known as “los libertadores” (youth volunteer defenders) fought against the Americans which resulted to a battle that drove the invaders to sail away. However, after the capture of Gen. 
			Aguinaldo, the local officials decided to surrender the town to the Americans. Public education and local water systems were opened the following year.</p>
			<p>In 1911, House Speaker Osmeña inaugurated the Rizal monument and the public elementary school building of Mambajao. In that same year, William Cameron Forbes visited Mambajao where he landed the first automobile ever to come to Mindanao.</p>
			<p>In 1924, Doña Agustina Borromeo founded the Academy of Our Lady which was managed later on by the Benedictine German sisters.</p>
			<p>After World War II the management of the academy was returned to laymen’s administration. The former principal was Ms. Asuncion B. Cagulada, now a religious sister named Madre Asuncion, R.V.M. Camiguin Institute became the first catholic high school in Mambajao and 
			in the entire Camiguin.</p>
			<p>On June 16, 1942, the Japanese army arrived and established its local government in the Municipality. They did not stay long but came back after hearing of the Camiguingnons’ guerrilla military plan. As a result of the Japanese and guerrilla encounter, the town was 
			burned by the Japanese army completely destroying sixty seven Spanish built houses, the Municipal Hall and the Catholic Parish Convent.</p>
			<br>
			
			<p>Finally, Mambajao regained its freedom from the Americans on February 2, 1944.</p>
			<p>On September 1, 1948, Mount Hibok-Hibok erupted for the first time killing people in the upland villages. It exploded again in September 14, 1949 burning to death 79 persons in Baylao, Agoho and Mambajao.</p>
			<p>On December 4, 1951 was Mount Hibok-Hibok’s third and most terrifying eruption that ever occurred in Camiguin where more than 1000 persons perished under rolling balls of fire that damaged almost 8 square kilometers of coconut land. Mambajao then became a ghost town 
			and the seat of local government was transferred to Barangay Tupsan. During this period Camiguin belonged to the Province of Misamis Oriental.</p>
			<p>On January 2, 1957, Camiguin Island was inaugurated as a sub-province with Dr. Jose P. Neri as its first Lieutenant Governor and Mambajao as its capital town.</p>
			<p>Today, Mambajao has emerged as the most economically and politically significant town in Camiguin being the hub of provincial governance, education, trade, business and tourism.</p>

			<p>Mambajeños were able to put up for the first time its potable water system for the whole town in 1903. The stone construction of San Nicolas de Tolentino Church soon followed and was completed in 1936. The projects were financed by the wealthy families of the town.</p>
			<p>In 1908, Speaker Sergio Osmeña of the first Philippine Assembly, together with Secretary Dionisio Jakosalem of the Ministry of Agriculture came to Mambajao. In 1909, Ms. Ruth Forbes with her son visited Mambajao as the personal house guests of the Reyes family. Ms. 
			Forbes acted as sponsor in the laying of the stone foundation of Rizal monument, incidentally the tallest Rizal monument in the country today.</p>
